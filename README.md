Project Name: SwatShare
Team Members: Julia Mammen, Ryleigh Vallejo, Alyssa Hayashi

Project Description:
SwatShare is an interface designed for the Swarthmore College community.
The problem that SwatShare is targeted to solve is the lack of communication,
information, and opinions shared amongst the student body. This platform allows
students to review specific courses (rating the course's lecture style, specific
professor, etc.), have an open discussion on any topic/discipline to help share
knowledge, learn by teaching, and assist underclassmen/students who have general
questions on courses, professors, majors/minors, topics in a specific class, etc.
We want to help break the barrier between the different disciplines and create a
more welcoming and interactive environment.

Set-up and running application instructions:

-Create a virtual environment (python3 -m venv .venv).
-Activate your virtual environment (source .venv/bin/activate).
-Install Flask and other required Python libraries (uv pip install flask flask-cors Flask-SQLAlchemy or uv pip install -r requirements.txt).
-Have your Flask application saved in app.py and run flask run --debug --reload.
-A link to our server will appear and if you open it in your browser, our
application will load.
